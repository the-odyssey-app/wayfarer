# Wayfarer Development Guidelines

## üéØ Development Philosophy

This project follows a **test-driven development approach** with emphasis on:
- Architecture-first design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Continuous integration and auditing
- Systematic feature addition

## üìã Code Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Architecture Quality (25%)
- **Inheritance Design**: Logical class hierarchy and maintainable structure
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, clear responsibility
- **Interface Design**: Clean and intuitive public APIs

### 2. Error Handling & Resilience (25%)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Exception Handling**: Appropriate exception catching and handling
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Backup strategies when primary methods fail

### 3. Business Logic Integration (20%)
- **Context Awareness**: Code adapts to different business contexts
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Customizable behavior without code changes
- **Template Usage**: Proper implementation of reusable patterns

### 4. Code Quality & Maintainability (20%)
- **Readability**: Self-documenting and easy to understand code
- **Consistency**: Follows established patterns and conventions
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without breaking existing functionality

### 5. Performance & Efficiency (10%)
- **Resource Usage**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
- **Caching**: Proper caching of expensive operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Appropriate throttling of external API calls

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Multi-Layer Testing Approach

#### 1. Unit Testing Layer
- Test individual components in isolation
- Use mock objects for external dependencies
- Focus on critical business logic and error handling paths

#### 2. Integration Testing Layer
- Test component interactions and data flow
- End-to-end workflows and API integrations
- Use test databases and mock external services

#### 3. System Testing Layer
- Test complete pipeline execution
- Full business scenarios with real data
- Performance, reliability, and business logic validation

#### 4. Regression Testing Layer
- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- Automated test suites run on every change
- All previously working features and edge cases

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Fail, implement, improve cycle
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications

## üîç Audit System

### Continuous Code Auditing

#### 1. Static Analysis Auditing
- Code quality metrics (complexity, maintainability, technical debt)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Dependency auditing and license compliance
- Code duplication detection

#### 2. Architecture Auditing
- Design pattern compliance verification
- Dependency analysis and circular dependency detection
- Interface consistency and API contract validation
- Configuration validation and completeness checks

#### 3. Performance Auditing
- Resource usage monitoring (memory, CPU, network)
- API call optimization and rate limiting effectiveness
- Database query analysis and optimization opportunities
- Scalability assessment under load

## üìÅ Code Organization

### Hierarchical Organization Strategy

#### 1. Domain-Driven Organization
- Organize code by business functionality
- Clear boundaries between different business areas
- Common functionality shared across domains
- Anti-corruption layers for external system protection

#### 2. Technical Layer Organization
- **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces and API endpoints
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core business rules and workflows
- **Data Access Layer**: Database and external service interactions
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Cross-cutting concerns and utilities

#### 3. Component-Based Organization
- Each business step as an independent component
- Factory pattern for centralized component creation
- Configuration-driven assembly
- Plugin architecture for extensibility

### Organization Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Single responsibility per class
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on needed interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Open-Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
